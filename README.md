# ChipTools_1.0
 A Barebones WIP Media Multitool because I don't like going on shady websites to download! First time using a GUI and Python
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've meant to create this personal project for quite a while now!
CC Hackathon gave me no excuse not to start.

This was a purely solo project, and while it isn't the most extravagant program in the world, from what I knew beforehand, I'd
say, I'm quite proud of myself here.

Haven't touched Python since freshman year of high school, let alone touched a new library for GUIs (customtkinter).
Most of the time was spent trying to figure out documentation and stuff.

In any case, ChipTools is a project created to be my "Swiss Army Knife" of mundane media management tasks.
I've made a lot of videos in the past before, but dealing with shady online mp4 downloaders was a very tedious task.

So, I started off with doing an actual usable downloader!
I hope you enjoy using it! More to come later.
